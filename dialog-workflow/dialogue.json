        "AI": "Welcome back, Sarah. I see from your last session you were working on interview anxiety. How are you feeling today?",
        "human": "(sighs) Honestly? I had another panic attack during practice interviews yesterday..."
    },
    {
        "AI": "I notice your voice shows distress (0.87) but you're trying to smile. Would you like to share what triggered the attack?",
        "human": "*wipes eyes* It's stupid... I froze when they asked about system design again."
    },
    {
        "AI": "That's not stupid at all. Our records show 78% of engineers struggle with system design interviews. Shall we review the 4-step framework we practiced?",
        "human": "(nods vigorously) Yes please... but can we go slower this time?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Of course. Let's start with just requirements gathering. Imagine: 'Design Twitter'. What would you ask first?",
        "human": "*deep breath* Umm... daily active users? Maybe... 100 million?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Good start! *displays progress chart* You're already asking better questions than last week. Now, why is scale important here?",
        "human": "(leaning forward) Because... the system needs to handle spikes when news breaks?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Exactly! *detects engaged facial expression (0.62 interest)* That's a key insight. Would you like to: (1) Dive deeper, or (2) Practice another question?",
        "human": "Option 2 please... but simpler than Twitter?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Good self-awareness. Let's try: 'Design a parking lot'. First question?",
        "human": "*taps chin* How many spaces? Types of vehicles? *voice confidence up 22%*"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Excellent! *plays cheerful tone* You've covered 3 key requirements already. I'm logging this progress in your skills journal.",
        "human": "Wait really? Last time I blanked completely..."
    },
    {
        "AI": "The data doesn't lie. Your Episodic Memory shows:",
        "human": "*squints at screen* Wow... my 'questions asked' metric went from 1.2 to 4.5?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Yes! And your anxiety scores dropped from 0.88 to 0.61. Would you like to:",
        "human": "Actually... can we try one more problem? Maybe medium difficulty?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Progress! *loads 'Design URL shortener' exercise* Remember: 1) Requirements 2) Capacity 3) APIs 4) Scaling. You've got this.",
        "human": "*deep breath* Okay... first, what's the shortening ratio?"
    },
    {
        "AI": "Perfect starting point! *detects steady breathing pattern* I'm saving this breakthrough session. Same time tomorrow?",
        "human": "Yes! And... thanks for not giving up on me."
